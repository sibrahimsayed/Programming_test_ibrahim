"""

- I assume that all needed data are obtained from a CSV file 

- The program obtains the inputs form ../Data directory

- The program outputs the results to ../Output directory

- All codes for the program test are in 'Programming_test_code.py'

Once you run the code, it asks you to select an option. Each option corresponds to the answer to one 

Question. Once you choose an option, the program reads the data, do the computation, and writer the results in an svc file located in 'Output' directory. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The code reads the data from (Data) directory:



- For Question 1 the input data file is (T_Fare_Flight_Q1.csv)

- For Question 1 the input data files are (T_Fare_info_Q2.csv) and (T_Flight_info_Q2.csv)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


For each question, the code generates the results and write it in the (Output) directory:



- For Question 1 part 1 the output file is (Question_1_Part_1_ClassesRatio.csv)

- For Question 1 part 2 the output file is (Question_1_Part_2_percentages.csv)

- For Question 1 the output file is (Question_2.csv)
